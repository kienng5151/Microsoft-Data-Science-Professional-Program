The generalised slope-intercept form of writing the equation of a straight line:

	𝑦 = 𝑚𝑥 + 𝑏
 
In this notation, m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

*************************************************************

Factorization

	(𝑎+𝑏)^2 = 𝑎^2 + 𝑏^2 + 2𝑎𝑏

*************************************************************

Standard quadratic equation in standard form::

	𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐

*************************************************************

Quadratic equation in vertex form:

	𝑦 = 𝑎(𝑥−ℎ)^2 + 𝑘
 
The neat thing about this form of the equation is that it tells us the coordinates of the vertex - it's at h,k.

Shortcuts for Solving Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equation in standard form: 

	𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐

A.
Calculating the Vertex from Standard Form

There's a quick and easy technique you can apply to get the vertex coordinates.

To find h (which is the x-coordinate of the vertex), apply the following formula:
	ℎ = −𝑏2/𝑎
 
After you've found h, use it in the quadratic equation to solve for k:
	𝐤 = 𝑎𝐡^2 + 𝑏𝐡 + 𝑐


B.
The Quadratic Formula

Another useful formula to remember is the quadratic formula, which makes it easy to calculate values for x when y is 0; or in other words:

	𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0

Here's the formula:

	𝑥 = −𝑏 ± √𝑏2−4𝑎𝑐 / 2𝑎

*************************************************************

Restrict x to a specific list of values - specifically any real number that is not 0. To indicate this, we can use the following notation:
	
	{𝑥 ∈ IR | x ≠ 0}
 
This is interpreted as "Any value for x where x is in the set of real numbers such that x is not equal to 0".
