### Question 1
You are working in Excel with a large table of data that includes a column of student scores.

You want to highlight the scores in the table so you can find the rows for the students who scored the top 10% of grades more easily.

Which Excel visualization should you use?

- Sparkline
- **Conditional Formatting**
- Slicer
- PivotTable


### Question 2

You are exploring a large table of sensor data in Excel, which contains the daily count of activations for two sensors named Sensor 1 and Sensor 2.

An extract from the table is shown below:

```
Date	        Sensor	        Counts
01/01/2016	Sensor 1	15423
01/01/2016	Sensor 2	16923
01/02/2016	Sensor 1	14963
01/02/2016	Sensor 2	17561
01/02/2016	Sensor 2	17561
01/03/2016	Sensor 1	14143
01/03/2016	Sensor 2	16157
```
What should you do to address the data quality issue evident in this sample?

- Modify values for the date column based on the date in the first row, with increments of one day per row.
- Sort the table so that the rows are displayed in descending date order.
- **Remove duplicate rows in the table based on a match across all columns.**
- Format the date column in a standard format such as YYYY-MM-DD.


### Question 3
You create a line chart in Excel, showing monthly rainfall levels over a period of 10 years.

You want the chart to indicate whether rainfall is generally rising, falling, or remaining at a consistent level.

What should you add to the chart?

- A second series of data
- Axis labels
- A legend
- **A trendline**


## Question 4

You are exploring sales data in Excel, and have created the following chart based on daily sales amounts for two products. Product 1 is shown in blue on the left, and Product 2 is shown in orange on the right.

![](BoxWhisker.png)

Which two of the following statements about the comparative daily sales volumes of the two products are supported by the chart?

- **There is greater variance in daily sales volumes for Product 1 than for Product 2.**
- Total sales of Product 2 are higher than sales for Product 1
- **The median daily sales amount for Product 1 is higher than that of Product 2.**
- Most days, equal amounts of Product 1 and Product 2 are sold.
- There are no days on which the sales amount for Product 2 are greater than for Product 1.


### Question 5

You have the following sample of data values:

1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5

What is the mode of this set of values?

- 2.5.
- **3.**
- 2.
- 4.

### Question 6

You are exploring data collected from an in-car monitoring system.

You calculate the correlation between Temperature and Tyre Pressure to be 0.89.

What hypothesis does this correlation support?

- **As temperature increases, tyre pressure increases.**
- As temperature increases, tyre pressure decreases.
- Changes in tyre pressure have no correlation with changes in temperature.

### Question 7

You are analyzing records of rainfall.

You want to determine whether the difference between this year's rainfall and the annual historical average is statistically significantly.

Which type of test should you perform?

- Two-Sample T-Test
- **One-Sample T-Test**
- Paired Sample T-Test
- ANOVA

### Question 8

You use regression to generate a function that operates on two variables (X1 and X2) to predict a label (Y).

The regression output shows the following coefficients:

Intercept: 12.576
X1: 2.32
X2: -1.3
Which of the following formulae describes the regression function?

 **Y = 12.576 + (X1 x 2.32) + (X2 x -1.3)**
